# kodi.service.subsautoloader
## Sub folder auto-loader kodi addon
Auto-loads subtitles from location `Name.of.the.release/Subs/Name.of.the.video/[number]_[language].srt` when user starts playback.

`[language]` is first language used from kodi settings(`Player > Subtitles > Preferred Subtitle Language`).

This form of Subtitle folder structure is mostly used in RARBG releases that include multiple videos(show season in one release).
