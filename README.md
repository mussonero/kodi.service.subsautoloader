# Kodi Addon: Autoload subtitles from `Subs` folder

### Description and configuration
Auto-loads subtitles from location `Subs/Name.of.the.video/[number]_[language].srt` on video playback.

`[language]` is first language used from kodi settings(`Player > Subtitles > Preferred Subtitle Language`).

This folder structure is mostly used in torrent releases(eg. RARBG) that contain multiple episodes(show season in one release).

### Installation and Usage
Download latest release from [releases](https://github.com/recrof/kodi.service.subsautoloader/releases/), then [Use kodi guide to install the addon zip file](https://kodi.wiki/view/Archive:Install_add-ons_from_zip_files). Subs autoloader should work right after installation.
